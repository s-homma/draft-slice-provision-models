      Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual network based on service requirements. It's a 
      fundamental concept of the 5G and the architecture and specification is under standardization in several 
      organizations. However, the definitions and scopes on network slicing are a bit vary by organization. This 
      document provides classification of provisioning models of network slice for clarifying the differences 
      on the definitions and scopes.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual networks depending on requirements of each service. 
      Network slicing receives attention due to factors such as diversity of services and devices, and it is also a 
      fundamental concept of the 5G for applying networks to such various types of requirements.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In addition, network slicing is expected to enable a business model to provide dedicated networks to 3rd parties 
      on-demand, called NSaaS (Network Slice as a Service). For such usage, in network slicing, provision of networks 
      which guarantee communication qualities from end to end would be required. However, the definitions are not authorized 
      over several SDOs (Standards Developing Organizations).
      </t>
      
      <t>
      This document clarifies provision patterns of network slice, and provides the definitions and purposes which are 
      available over several organizations.
      </t>

    <section title="Definition of Terms">
      <t>
      This section lists definitions and terminologies related to network slicing. They refer ones of <xref target="TS.28.530-3GPP"/>
      and <xref target="NGMN-5G-White-Paper"/>.

      <t hangText="Network Slicing:">
      Network slicing is a technology or an approach to create separate virtual networks in support of 
      services, depending on several requirements, on the same physical resources. This is possible by 
      combinations of several network technologies.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice (NS):">
      An NS is a virtual network established on network infrastructure. Some include additional network 
      functions such as firewall or load-balancer in addition to basically forwarding functions such as 
      switches or routers. It has an overlay architecture and is independent from the underlay network's 
      topology.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice Subnet (NS-Subnet):">
      An NS subnet is partially virtual network established within a single domain.
      </t>
      
      
      <t hangText="End-to-End Network Slice (E2E-NS):">
      An E2E-NS is a virtual network connecting between end points. E2E slices are composed of a single NS 
      subnet or multiple NS subnets.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS):">
      An NSaaS is a NS distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts NSs and makes them available 
      to customers.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice Tenant (NS Tenant):">
      An NS tenant is a person or group that rents and occupies NSs from NS providers.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Domain:">
      A domain is a group of a network and devices administrated as a unit with common rules and procedures.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Resource:">
      A resource is element used to create virtual networks. There are several types of resources, i.e., 
      connectivity, computing and storage. The details are described <xref target="NS-Rsrc"/>
      </t>
      
      
      <t hangText="Virtual Network:">
      A virtual network is a network running a number of virtual network functions. 
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Virtual Network Function (VNF):"> 
      A virtual network function (VNF) is a network function whose functional 
      software is decoupled from hardware. One or more virtual machines running different software and 
      processes on top of industry-standard high-volume servers, switches and storage, or cloud computing 
      infrastructure, and capable of implementing network functions traditionally implemented via custom 
      hardware appliances and middleboxes (e.g., router, NAT, firewall, load balancer, etc.)

    <section title="General Requirements for Network Slicing">
      <t>
      On network slice operation, capability of dynamic instantiation, change, and delete would be required because 
      an NS is established based on received order from a tenant. From this aspect, some mechanism to design a network 
      based on service requirements and to convert concrete configurations based on the design would be required. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In addition, each NS has to maintain definite communication quality from end to end, and resource reservations 
      on data plane and isolation among NSs would be required. Isolation is a concept to prevent some reduction of 
      communication quality caused by disturbance from another or other NSs, and it has some levels on the strength, 
      such as hard or soft isolations. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The required promptness of slice operation and granularity of communication quality would vary depending on 
      provisioning model.

    <section anchor="NS-Types" title="Types of Network Slices on Provision to Tenants">
      <t>
      The types of NSs on their provision are mainly categorized into two types: ready-made(RM) NS and custom-made(CM) NS. 
      This section describes the features of these types.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="RM-NS" title="Ready-made Network Slice">
        <t>
        An RM-NS is a NS which the infrastructure operator decides requirements and established based on them in advance. 
        A tenant selects one of RM-NSs whose requirements are closer to its requrest. As examples of usages of RM-NSs, 
        the following three types communication is advocated in 3GPP (Ref. <xref target="TS.28.530-3GPP"/>).
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="URLLC (Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication):">
          NS for URLLC provides low-latency and High reliable communication, and it is expected to be used for services which 
          require real-time control such as connected vehicles.
          </t>
          
          <t hangText="eMBB (enhanced Mobile BroadBand):">
          NS for eMBB provides high-capacity bandwidth communication, and it is expected to be used for services which consume 
          enormous traffic such as VR/AR and high quality video streaming(e.g., 4K/8K).
          </t>
          
          <t hangText="mIoT (massive IoT):">
          mIoT NS provides connectivity for massive number of IoT devices such as smart meters.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="CM-NS" title="Custom-made Network Slice">
        <t>
        A CM-NS is a NS which is established based on an order from an external and provided to it. As examples of usage of CM-NS, 
        an enterprise builds and operate a virtual network for connecting several bases, or OTT (Over The Top) or other industrial 
        service providers use NSs as a part of their own services (e.g., connected vehicles/drones, online video games, or remote surgery). 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        In this model, network operation system would be required to have intelligence and orchestration function(s) to create the 
        appropriate network on-demand.
        </t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="NS-Provision-Model" title="Network Slice Provision Models">
      <t>
      This section describes provision models of NSs on NSaaS.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Provision Models">
        <t>
        The provision models are categorized into three models: 
        SaaS (Service as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) like models as below. 
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="SaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, an infrastructure operator designs NS templates in advance, and a tenant selects and uses one which fulfills 
          most its requirement from the templates. The specifications of NSs are abstracted to KPI as networks and servers and shown 
          to tenants. In short, detailed parameters of infrastructure network are hidden from tenant. RM-NS is categorized into this model.
          </t>
        
          <t hangText="PaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, a tenant offers its request shown with connected area, KPIs, and included service functions, and infrastructure operators 
          designs a template and instantiate an NS based on the request dynamically. The configurable values would vary depending on policy 
          of each NS provider. 
          </t>
        
          <t hangText="IaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, a tenant designs and instantiates NSs by indicating concrete resources to infrastructure operators. In other words, 
          infrastructure operators provide just their resources, and NSs are coordinated by tenant.

        <t>Note that, in some cases, an E2E-NS may be established by stitching different types of NS-subnets. </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      In IaaS-like model on NS provisioning, some mechanisms, such as authentication for APIs, to prevent illegal access to infrastructure 
      would be required.
      </t>
    
      <t>Other considerations are TBD</t>
