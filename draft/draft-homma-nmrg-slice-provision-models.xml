      Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual network based on service requirements. It's a 
      fundamental concept of the 5G and the architecture and specification is under standardization in several 
      organizations. However, the definitions and scopes of network slicing vary to some degree from one organization 
      to another. This document provides classification of provisioning models of network slice for clarifying the differences 
      on the definitions and scopes.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual networks depending on requirements of each service. 
      Network slicing receives attention due to factors such as diversity of services and devices, and it is also a 
      fundamental concept of the 5G for applying networks to such various types of requirements.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In addition, network slicing is expected to enable a business model to provide dedicated networks to 3rd parties 
      on-demand, called NSaaS (Network Slice as a Service). For such usage, in network slicing, provision of networks 
      able to guarantee communication characteristics end to end would be required. However, the definitions are not harmonized 
      over several SDOs (Standards Developing Organizations).
      </t>
      
      <t>
      This document clarifies provision patterns of network slice, and provides the definitions and purposes which are 
      available over several organizations.
      </t>

    <section title="Definition of Terms">
      <t>
      This section lists definitions and terms related to network slicing. They refer ones in <xref target="TS.28.530-3GPP"/>
      and <xref target="NGMN-5G-White-Paper"/>.

      <t hangText="Network Slicing:">
      Network slicing is a technology or an approach to create logical separate networks in support of 
      services, depending on several requirements, on the same physical resources. This is possible by 
      combinations of several network technologies.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice (NS):">
      An NS is a general name of logical separate networks instantiated on a network infrastructure. It includes 
      Network Slice Instance, Network Slice Subnet Instance, and End-to-End Network Slice Instance.
      </t>
      
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice Instance (NSI):">
      An NSI is a logical network instantiated with network resources such as links, switches an routers, 
      and some include additional network service functions such as firewall or load-balancer. It is composed of 
      one or more Network Slice Subnet Instances. When it provides connectivity from end to end for end users, 
      it is called End-to-End Network Slice Instance. An NSI has an overlay architecture and is independent of 
      the underlay network's topology.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice Subnet Instance (NSSI):">
      An NSSI is a partially virtual network instantiated within a single domain.
      </t>
      
      
      <t hangText="End-to-End Network Slice Instance (E2E-NSI):">
      An E2E-NS is a virtual network connecting among end points. It is composed of one or multiple NSSIs.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS):">
      An NSaaS is a NS distribution model in which a third-party provider or a vertical customer hosts NSIs 
      and makes them available to customers.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Network Slice Tenant (NS Tenant):">
      An NS tenant is a person or group that rents and occupies NSs from NS providers.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Domain:">
      A domain is a group of a network and devices administrated as a unit with common rules and procedures.
      </t>
      
      <t hangText="Resource:">
      A resource is an element used to create virtual networks. There are several types of resources, i.e., 
      connectivity, computing and storage. The details are described <xref target="NS-Rsrc"/>

      processes on top of industry-standard high-volume servers, switches and storage, or cloud computing 
      infrastructure, and capable of implementing network functions traditionally implemented via custom 
      hardware appliances and middleboxes (e.g., router, NAT, firewall, load balancer, etc.)

    </section>

    
    <section title="General Requirements for Network Slicing">
      <t>
      On network slice operations, capabilities for dynamic instantiation, change, and deletion should be required because 
      an NS is established based on received orders from tenants. From this aspect, some mechanisms to design a network 
      based on service requirements and to convert concrete configurations based on the design would be required. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In addition, each NS has to maintain concrete communication characteristics end to end, and resource reservations 
      on data plane and isolation among NSs would be required. Isolation is a concept to prevent the reduction of 
      communication quality caused by disturbance from other NSs, and it may have some levels of strength, 
      such as hard or soft isolations. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The required agility of slice operation and granularity of communication quality requested can vary depending on 
      provisioning model.
      </t>

        An E2E-NS is constructed by stitching NS subnets instantiated on each participating domain. This includes the 
        simplest case of a single NS subnet as an E2E NS. Domain types where some NS-subnets are established are described below:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Fixed access network</t>
          <t>Mobile access network</t>
          <t>Transport network</t>
          <t>Fixed core network</t>
          <t>Mobile core network</t>
          <t>Data center (DC)</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      
        <t>
        <xref target="Overview-NS-Structure"/> describes the overview of this structure. Access network, core network, and DC domains 
        provide NS-subnets by combining network/server resources, and an E2E-NS is established by stitching these NS-subnets. Ways to 
        stitch NS-subnets are described in <xref target="I-D.defoy-coms-subnet-interconnection"/> and 
        <xref target="I-D.homma-nfvrg-slice-gateway"/>.

      <section anchor="Players-on-NS" title="Stakeholders in the Structuring Network Slices">
        <t>
        On a basic NS structure, an E2E-NS is established by either following Stakeholders:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>One of NS-subnet providers</t>
          <t>Service provider (user of E2E-NS)</t>
          <t>Others (e.g., external coordinator)</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>
        Other potential stakeholders in network slicing are described below:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="NS-subnet provider:">
          infrastructure operator
          </t>
          <t hangText="E2E-NS provider:">
          infrastructure operator, coordinator
          </t>
          <t hangText="NS tenant:">
          infrastructure operator, service provider, enterprise, mass user
          </t>
          <t hangText="End customer:">
          enterprise, mass user
          </t>

    <section anchor="NS-Types" title="Types of Network Slices by their Provision to Tenants">
      <t>
      NSs can be classified according to their provision pattern into tow typpes: ready-made(RM) NS and custom-made(CM) NS. 
      This section describes the features of these types.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="RM-NS" title="Ready-made Network Slice">
        <t>
        An RM-NS is a NS which the infrastructure operator decides requirements for, and established based on them in advance. 
        A tenant selects one of RM-NSs whose features are closer to its requirements. As examples of usages of RM-NSs, 
        the following three types communication is advocated in 3GPP (Ref. <xref target="TS.28.530-3GPP"/>).
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="URLLC (Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication):">
          NS for URLLC provides low-latency and High reliable communication, and it is expected to be used for services which 
          require real-time control such as connected vehicles.
          </t>
          
          <t hangText="eMBB (enhanced Mobile BroadBand):">
          NS for eMBB provides high-capacity bandwidth communication, and it is expected to be used for services which consume 
          high volumes of traffic such as VR/AR and high quality video streaming(e.g., 4K/8K).
          </t>
          
          <t hangText="mIoT (massive IoT):">
          mIoT NS provides connectivity for massive number of IoT devices such as smart meters.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="CM-NS" title="Custom-made Network Slice">
        <t>
        A CM-NS is a NS which is established based on an order from a tenant and provided to it. As examples of usage of CM-NS, 
        an enterprise builds and operates a virtual network for connecting several bases, or OTT (Over The Top) or other industrial 
        service providers can use NSs as a part of their own services (e.g., connected vehicles/drones, online video games, or remote surgery). 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        In this model, network operation system would be required to incorperate intelligence and orchestration function(s) to create the 
        appropriate network on-demand.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
 
    <section anchor="NS-Provision-Model" title="Network Slice Provision Models">
      <t>
      Three provision models are defined:
      </t>
      
      <section title="Provision Models">
        <t>
        The provision models are categorized into three models: 
        SaaS (Service as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) like models as below. 
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="SaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, an infrastructure operator designs NS templates in advance, and a tenant selects and uses one which fulfills 
          most its requirement among the templates. The specifications of NSs are abstracted to KPIs as networks and servers and shown 
          to tenants. In short, detailed parameters of infrastructure network are hidden from tenant. RM-NS is categorized into this model.
          </t>
        
          <t hangText="PaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, a tenant makes its request, including connected area, KPIs and included service functions, and infrastructure operator 
          designs a template and instantiate an NS based on the request dynamically. The configurable values would vary depending on the policy 
          of each NS provider. 
          </t>
        
          <t hangText="IaaS-like Model:">
          In this model, a tenant designs and instantiates NSs by indicating concrete resources to infrastructure operators. In other words, 
          infrastructure operators provide just their resources, and NSs are coordinated by the tenant.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>Note that, in some cases, NS-subnets which composing an E2E-NS may be provided with different provision models. </t>
      </section>

          
      <section title="Configurable Values on Provision Models">
        <t>TBD</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      In IaaS-like model on NS provisioning, some mechanisms, such as authentication for APIs, to prevent illegal access to infrastructure 
      would be required.
      </t>
    
      <t>Other considerations are TBD</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="IANA Considerations">

    This memo includes no request to IANA.
